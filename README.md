###This is not Emacs, this is (just) a Nu Editor

See programming.nu for the marvelous Nu programming language.
This is not a finished work,
more a kind of demo for the NuCodeEditor class, 
a subclass of NSTextView

There are some additions to the syntax of Nu,
which are just experiments, some more, some less useful.

Press the help button in Nutor.app to see more.
Also there are some examples in the editor dirctory.
The header files give you some background information.
